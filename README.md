## Consultant

I work for OCTO Technology as consultant.

Part of my job is to understand the business problems of the companies and to help them build the best solution.

I also like to keep a foot in the technological implementation.
For example [this tool](https://github.com/owulveryck/wardleyToGo) has been built to facilitate the generation of maps:
